# inactive-iam-users

Forked from: https://github.com/devops-made-easy/disable-inactive-aws-iam-users
This project makes sure that AWS GovCloud IAM Console users that have not been active for 60 days get disabled automatically and then sends a notification to slack channel.
This is to ensure compliance with SP 800-53 AC-2(3) "The information system shall automatically disable inactive accounts after a time period not to exceed 60 days."
